      <h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
      <p>This project allows our team to create an interesting mobile application.
        Our team decided to create an informative and interactive blood donation mobile application that helps
        the user to easily understand the process and requirements of blood donations.
        The interactive system includes primary features such as eligibility check, scheduling donations,
        pre-fill forms to reduce wait time at clinics, tracking where your contributions go, and providing
        ineligible donors with an option to donate blood for research.</p>

          <p>From research to synthesis to preliminary ideation, our team decided to
            create a blood donation mobile application based on the following reasons.</p>

            <h4>Issue 1 | LOW RETURNING RATE</h4>
            <p>
              Although more and more people are willing to donate blood, the returning rates of people
              donating two, three or four times are in low percentages. Donors, in general, are not aware
              of the sense of duty and pride of being a blood donor, and the effect that they can make after they donate blood.<p>

                <h4>Issue 2 | BLOOD SHORTAGE</h4>
                <p>According to the Canadian Blood Service, the nation is experiencing a critical shortage
                  in blood inventory. Because of the short shelf life of donated blood, more regular donors
                  are required to maintain a strong inventory of various blood types. Yet, less than 4% of
                  eligible donors are regularly donating blood each year.  </p>

                                        <h4>CHALLENGES + REFLECTION</h4>
                                        <p>People are not willing to return to contributing to others (eg. donating blood)
                                          because they feel like their contributions are going nowhere/don’t know what happens to them.
                                          Another pain point for donors are the lengthy form that is requried for each donation,
                                          another issue is that donors don’t recieve self-credit for what they have done,
                                          they donate blood but does not know where and when the blood is being used. It was hard to solve the problem and we did not really increase motivation toward the user. To cope with this problem,
                                          We create a more complex tracking feature to allow the user to keep track of their donation and feel more contributed.</p>
