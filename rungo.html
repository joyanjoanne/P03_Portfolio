        <h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
        <p>The project is to design a new feature for new and intermediate users.
          Rungo is an existing mobile application that allows the user to find,
          create and follow a new running route by turn-by-turn navigation.
          Our team decided to design a new feature for Rungo to give it a higher engaging rate between the user and Rungo.
          To achieve our goal, we approach with lateral thinking to solve problems using indirect and creative
          ways with reasons stated clearly.</p>

          <h4>1. UNDERSTANDING RUNGO</h4>
          <p>Before actually designing the new feature for Rungo,
            it is important to complete some exploratory and evaluative
            research to understand Rungo's existing interface, interaction patterns,
            features, and users, with its core language, patterns, and workflows.  </p>

      <h4>CHALLENGES + REFLECTION</h4>
      <p>While deciding on what to design as a new feature, our team come up with three ideas.
        As one of the ideas was to target an office lady with a tight schedule. We were thinking
        of having the Rungo application to be an application that helps connect the users with his
        family and friends. The goal was to help the user with a tight schedule could still have a
        high participating rate by combining his daily life ( shopping time with friends, drinking
        time with friends ) to the running routine. So, the user can run with friends and save time
        at the same time. However, making it a social application could be hard to maintain, and it
        is not what Rungo wants as a running application. We overcome the problem with iterating more
        deeply in the other ideas. So, we can focus on target audiences with a better solution and create a better scope.</p>
